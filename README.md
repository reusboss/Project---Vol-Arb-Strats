# Project---Vol-Arb-Strats
This is the project considering fecthing agriculture commodities options data historically and implying the IV from the Black76 model.\
We will use available 15-30 minute, 08:30am-13:20pm contract quotes and bid\ask\strike prices for daily data. \
We try to implement a functor so that we could do statistical analysis on vol surface by previous ten years' daily option contracts data.\
Ultimatelyy, we will consider a quant vol arb strategy given the curve analysis.\
